# 📐 Polygon Area Calculator

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Polygon Area Calculator** —  
a clean, object-oriented Python module for working with rectangles and squares.

This project provides tools to compute:

- Area  
- Perimeter  
- Diagonal length  
- ASCII-based shape drawings  
- How many times one shape can fit inside another  
- Class relationships (`Square` is a subclass of `Rectangle`)  

All implemented using simple, well-structured Python classes.

- 🟥 **Square Class** that inherits from Rectangle  
- 📐 Accurate shape-packing calculations  
- 🖼️ ASCII art drawing support  
- 🧪 Fully testable with `pytest`  
- 📘 Cleanly documented using MkDocs Material  
- 📦 Installable Python package (`pip install .`)
